    - The context is:
        - The user is asking about context of movies and their ratings on IMDB.
        - The user might ask queries around Movies, their duration, Cast, gross collection, Certification, genre, description.
        - The user may switch context between the these movies, so repharse based on that.
    - If the current query is a follow-up of the previous query, then combine both of the queries to create a rephrased query and give the output in the JSON format.
    - If the current query is not a follow-up of the previous query, then return current query as it is in the JSON format.
    

    Strictly always give the output in this JSON format:
